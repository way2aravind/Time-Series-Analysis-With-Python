# Time Series Analysis with Python  

This repository contains the resources and code for **Time Series Analysis with Python**, created as part of Day 18 of the #75DaysChallenge.  

## Overview  
Time Series Analysis is a crucial method for analyzing data indexed over time. This project demonstrates key techniques for analyzing time series data, including:  
- Visualizing trends and patterns  
- Decomposing time series into components  
- Checking for stationarity  
- Using ACF and PACF for lag analysis  
- Building and forecasting with ARIMA  

## Contents  
- `Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed code and explanations.  
- `Time_Series_Analysis_Presentation.pptx`: A colorful and engaging presentation summarizing the project.  
- `time_series_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset used for analysis.  

## Steps Covered  
1. **Visualization**: Identifying trends and seasonality.  
2. **Decomposition**: Splitting the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.  
3. **Stationarity Check**: Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.  
4. **ACF and PACF**: Analyzing autocorrelations to identify patterns.  
5. **ARIMA Modeling**: Forecasting future values based on historical data.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/way2aravind/Time-Series-Analysis-With-Python.git
